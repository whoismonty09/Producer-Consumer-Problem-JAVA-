# 🔄 Producer-Consumer Problem (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Java console-based implementation of the classic Producer-Consumer problem. It demonstrates how multiple threads can safely share a common resource using synchronization techniques.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Producer thread generates data  
- Consumer thread consumes data  
- Shared buffer between producer and consumer  
- Thread-safe communication  
- Prevents race conditions using synchronization  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java (Core Java)  
- Multithreading  
- Synchronization  
- wait() and notify() methods  

---

## 📚 Concepts Applied
- Threads and concurrency  
- Synchronization blocks  
- Inter-thread communication  
- Shared resource management  
- Control flow in multithreaded programs  

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Compile and run the Java program  
2. Observe producer and consumer threads working simultaneously  
3. Check console output for produced and consumed values

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Learned how to implement multithreading in Java  
- Understood synchronization and thread safety  
- Practiced inter-thread communication using wait() and notify()  
- Solved a classic concurrency problem  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Support multiple producers and consumers  
- Add bounded buffer size  
- Display thread execution statistics  
- GUI simulation using JavaFX
